# Avocado Demand Analysis & Prediction
### Time of Project: Fall 2019
### Class Project
### Masters of Science in Data Analytics, UTSA

For this project, my classmates and I analyzed avocado sales across the United States to determine where and when the most avocados are sold, where are they the most expansive, where and when is the greatest and lowest demand and price, and if demand could be modeled based on price. Included comaprisons between conventionally grown and organically grown avocados.

I was responsible for the modeling part of this project. To predict demand, I developed an ARIMA model with a transfer function. I also included various "pulse" events. In addition, I developed and ARIMA model to predict price and a UCM model to predict demand.

There was no report for this project, so please see the [Final Presentation](https://github.com/iscarff123/AvocadoDemandPrediction/raw/main/Final%20Presentation.pptx) file for more details.
